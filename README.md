The site is still a work in progress, and one of my main goals is to make it fully responsive across all screen sizes and devices. At the moment, the layout and functionality are being refined, but the current version already highlights my approach to implementing core web development practices such as semantic HTML, modular CSS, and intuitive navigation. By focusing on these elements, I aim to create a solid foundation that can be easily expanded and optimized in future iterations.

A major part of this project is improving the overall user experience. This includes designing clear navigation paths, ensuring consistency in visual elements, and working towards accessibility standards so that the website can be used by a wider audience. Although responsiveness is still under development, I am actively testing and adjusting layouts to make sure the design adapts smoothly to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

Beyond its technical aspects, this project represents my learning journey. Every update reflects my effort to adopt better coding practices, experiment with styling techniques, and gain confidence in structuring a real-world website project. It also gives me a chance to document my workflow and problem-solving process, which is an important part of becoming a stronger developer.

In the future, I plan to expand this website by adding more interactive features, optimizing performance, and enhancing its design with responsive animations and transitions. The ultimate goal is to build a professional-grade website that not only looks modern but also functions seamlessly for all users.

This project is a valuable step in my portfolio, as it demonstrates both my current capabilities and my commitment to continuous improvement in web development.
